TODO:
when plotting:
    data cleaning:
        find ranges with continuous streaming data - look for gaps in data > 1s
        look for burst or catch up data - more than one data point with the same app timestamp
            maybe need to compare the API timestamp to the recv_time timestamp, even though the APO timestamp does not have sub-1 sec resolution

Qt and threads?
